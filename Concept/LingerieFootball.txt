A proposed concept for a Lingerie Football game, featuring protagnist(s) trying to initiate a Lingerie Football.

Concept 1: The Misfit Rebellion (Fleshed-Out)
Logline: A band of campus outcasts, tired of being sidelined, form a satirical "lingerie" football league to mock the school's hyper-masculine sports culture. What starts as a joke quickly becomes a genuine movement, as they discover a love for the game, a powerful sense of community, and the challenge of fighting for their right to play.
The Pitch:
At the prestigious and sports-obsessed Northwood University, the official football team, the "Stallions," are treated like gods. For everyone else who doesn't fit the jock or cheerleader mold, campus life can feel exclusionary. Our protagonist is Quinn, a cynical and sharp-tongued art student who, after one too many encounters with the Stallions' entitlement, sarcastically suggests to her friends that they should start their own "Lingerie Football League."
The idea, meant as a joke, catches fire with a motley crew of students who have been on the fringes of campus life:
The Strategist: A shy but brilliant gamer who applies complex video game strategies to the football field.
The Performer: A flamboyant theater major who designs the team's "uniforms" as elaborate, empowering costumes and treats every game like a piece of performance art.
The Jaded Athlete: A former track star who quit the official team due to its toxic, high-pressure environment and is just looking to have fun with sports again.
The Activist: A passionate social justice advocate who sees the league as a way to protest the university's skewed priorities and promote body positivity.
Their initial goal is satire. They want to hold a mirror up to the absurdity of college sports worship. However, as they begin to practice, they find something unexpected: joy, camaraderie, and a genuine passion for the sport. They decide to make their league a reality, focusing on inclusivity and fun—a stark contrast to the real-world history of the Lingerie Football League, which faced criticism for exploiting its athletes and prioritizing sex appeal over safety.[1][2]
The core of the visual novel would be navigating the immense pushback they receive. The university administration, fearing a PR nightmare, will try to shut them down, creating bureaucratic hurdles that the player must navigate.[3][4][5] The established sports teams will mock and antagonize them. The team will also have to confront public perception and defend their mission against accusations of being a joke or being anti-feminist.
Player Choices Will Influence:
The Team's Identity: Will the team lean into satire and protest, or focus on becoming a genuinely competitive force?
Recruitment: Who will you be able to convince to join the team, and how will you manage the clashing personalities?
Conflict Resolution: How will you deal with the administration, rival teams, and internal disputes? Your choices will affect team morale and your public image.
Relationships: Deepen your friendships with your teammates, forge alliances with unexpected allies, and perhaps even find romance in the midst of the chaos.
This is an underdog story about a found family who reclaims a controversial concept and reshapes it into something empowering and joyful.
Alternative Premises
Here are a few other directions you could take the 'College Lingerie Football League' title:
Alternative Premise 1: The Undercover Exposé
The Concept: The protagonist is a determined young journalism student who goes undercover to join a newly formed and highly controversial College Lingerie Football League. Her goal is to write a career-making exposé on what she assumes is an exploitative and demeaning organization. However, as she trains and competes, she discovers a complex world of fierce athletes, unexpected sisterhood, and personal struggles that challenge her black-and-white view of the situation. She'll have to grapple with the ethics of her investigation as she grows closer to the women she's supposed to be exposing. This narrative would directly engage with the real-world issues of the former LFL, such as players not being paid and suffering serious injuries with little support.[6][7]
Core Mechanic: A branching narrative based on "evidence" gathering and dialogue choices that shift the protagonist's beliefs and the ultimate tone of her article, from a scathing hit-piece to a nuanced human-interest story.
Alternative Premise 2: The High-Stakes Sports Drama
The Concept: In this world, the College Lingerie Football League is an established, ultra-competitive, and semi-professional league with scholarships, intense rivalries, and a dark side. The protagonist is a talented rookie on a full scholarship to the league's most successful and ruthless team. The story is a gritty sports drama about the physical and emotional toll of high-stakes competition. It would explore themes of ambition, betrayal, the pressure to maintain a certain image, and the sacrifices required to be the best. The "lingerie" aspect is part of the league's branding, a constant source of tension between the players' athleticism and the administration's marketing machine.
Core Mechanic: A focus on skill-based choices during games that determine victory or defeat, alongside complex relationship management with teammates who are also your direct rivals for the top spot.
Alternative Premise 3: The Business School Satire
The Concept: The protagonist is an overly ambitious and slightly clueless business major who sees a gap in the campus entertainment market. Armed with spreadsheets and a "disruptive" mindset, they decide to start a Lingerie Football League as a get-rich-quick scheme. They know nothing about football or team management, leading to a series of hilarious and disastrous events. The protagonist must try to keep their chaotic enterprise from falling apart while dealing with eccentric players, angry university officials, and the dawning realization that they've created something far more meaningful—and complicated—than they ever intended.
Core Mechanic: A resource management and comedic visual novel. The player would make business decisions (often with terrible, unforeseen consequences) that impact the team's finances, morale, and public perception, all while trying to pass their classes and not get expelled.
